They are `.hot` files.

   OR
   Download the project source code and build the dll yourself.

2. Place the `MOREApps.dll` in the `Mods` folder of your game directory.

## Installing Melonloader
There are many YouTube tutorials on how to install mods for any Unity game I recommend checking one out (it's easy).

1. Install Melonloader [here](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=requirements).
2. Launch Melonloader.
3. Find the game executable (SH.exe).
   This can be done by alt-clicking Superhot in Steam > "Manage" > "Browse local files".
4. Follow the rest of the directions provided by Melonloader and a mods folder should appear.
5. See installation -- drag the dll into the mods folder.
